# Cosine_Similarity-and-Cosine_Distance
**Overview**
This project demonstrates the use of cosine similarity and cosine distance metrics to compare textual documents based on their feature representations. The project involves calculating these metrics for a set of documents that discuss iPhone and Galaxy phone sales and performance.

**Steps**

**Cosine Similarity Calculation:**
Calculate cosine similarity between vectors representing different documents.
Compare documents to determine their similarity based on the given feature sets.

**Document Feature Representation:**
Represent each document as a vector based on the occurrence of key terms (iPhone and galaxy).
Create a DataFrame to hold these vectors for each document.

**Cosine Distance Calculation:**
Calculate cosine distances to provide an alternative measure of similarity.
Interpret the cosine distance results to understand differences between documents.

**Datasets**
Documents: Four documents discussing iPhone and Galaxy phone sales, features, and market performance.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn

**Usage**
**Cosine Similarity:** Use cosine similarity to quantify the similarity between pairs of documents.
**Cosine Distance:** Use cosine distance to measure the dissimilarity between pairs of documents.
**Feature Representation:** Understand how to represent text documents as feature vectors for similarity analysis.
